## Brainstorming for Quarter 2 Project Proposal

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The topic that fascinated me the most this quarter was understanding how different patterns of task allocation affect overall work efficiency. I found it really interesting to see how dividing responsibilities or adjusting workload distribution can influence both individual and team productivity. It made me think more critically about how data-driven analysis could be used to improve coordination in real projects.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For my Quarter 2 project, I would like to explore ways to improve project management practices within SDGE by analyzing task assignment data. Specifically, I want to identify patterns that correlate with higher efficiency or smoother project completion. The goal would be to provide insights or recommendations that could help optimize how projects are structured or how responsibilities are shared across teams.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change I might make depends on whether I can identify a more effective analytical framework. So far, the approach in Quarter 1 has been somewhat exploratory, and I think incorporating clearer evaluation metrics or focusing more on feature selection could make the results stronger. I’m still keeping things flexible since I want to adapt my methods once more data becomes available.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I’d like to try incorporating deep learning methods, especially for pattern recognition and prediction. For example, using neural networks could help uncover subtle relationships between different project management variables that might not be visible with simpler models. I’m also interested in experimenting with visualization tools to make the insights more intuitive and actionable.
